## Missions, tasks, and crew

Salvage revolves around three core concepts:

- **Missions**: Think of these as the central projects or operations you’ll run. Missions contain information like location, risk level, and overall objectives.
- **Tasks**: Each mission breaks down into smaller tasks or subtasks. You assign tasks to crew members to make sure every detail is covered.
- **Crew**: Crew members bring specialized skills—like piloting or engineering—to help complete tasks. You choose who to include in each mission based on skill level and availability.

By understanding how these pieces fit together, you can plan and manage your salvaging operations from start to finish.
