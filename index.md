# Welcome to Salvage

Salvage is the galaxy’s first app built specifically for space scavengers to manage missions, coordinate tasks, and track crucial details—from risk levels to crew assignments. This documentation site helps you understand every aspect of Salvage, whether you’re a new user taking on your first mission or a developer integrating with our API.

Use the side navigation to browse topics at your own pace. If you’re just getting started, check out our upcoming *Getting started* guide for an introduction to key features and step-by-step onboarding instructions.

We’re excited to help you streamline your space salvaging operations, so let’s get to it!
